## TAKEDA project: Combinational treatment of Tak-676 with PD-1 blocker (Pembrolizumab) in Mesothelioma 

This is a document for collection of all raw data.  

#### Rationale. 

TAK-676 is a highly potent modulator of both the innate and adaptive immune system and that it promotes the activation of dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and T cells in preclinical models 

In syngeneic murine tumor models in vivo, TAK-676 induces dose-dependent cytokine responses and increases the activation and proliferation of immune cells within the TME and tumor-associated lymphoid tissue. We also demonstrate that TAK-676 dosing results in significant STING- dependent antitumor activity, including complete regressions and durable memory T-cell immunity. We show that TAK-676 is well tolerated, exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics in plasma, and exhibits higher exposure in tumor. The intravenous administration of TAK-676 provides potential treatment benefit in a broad range of tumor types. Further study of TAK-676 in first-in-human phase I trials is ongoing. 

Significance: TAK-676 is a novel systemic STING agonist demonstrating robust activation of innate and adaptive immune activity resulting in durable antitumor responses within multiple syngeneic tumor models. Clinical investigation of TAK-676 is ongoing.
