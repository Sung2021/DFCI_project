## Mesothelioma  

Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the mesothelial cells lining the pleura (the membranes around the lungs), peritoneum (the membranes lining the abdominal cavity), and other organs. Identifying specific marker genes for mesothelioma can be challenging due to its rarity and heterogeneity. However, some genes have been found to be associated with mesothelioma. 

1. **Calretinin (CALB2):** Calretinin is a calcium-binding protein that is often used as a positive marker for mesothelial cells, and its expression can be elevated in mesothelioma.

2. **WT1 (Wilms Tumor 1):** WT1 is a transcription factor that is expressed in normal mesothelial cells and is often used as a diagnostic marker for mesothelioma.


4. **Podoplanin (PDPN):** Podoplanin is a glycoprotein expressed in various types of mesothelial cells and can be used as a marker for distinguishing mesothelioma from other cancers.

5. **Cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6):** Cytokeratin 5/6 is a combination of two cytokeratin proteins that are often expressed in mesothelial cells and some mesothelioma cases.

6. **BAP1 (BRCA1-Associated Protein 1):** Mutations in the BAP1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of mesothelioma. While not a diagnostic marker, BAP1 is relevant for understanding mesothelioma genetics.

### Mesothelioma and its relation to Epithelial Cells   
Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the mesothelium, a thin layer of tissue that covers internal organs in the body. It is often associated with exposure to asbestos, a mineral that was widely used in construction and manufacturing until its health risks were discovered.

Epithelial cells are one of the three main types of cells that make up the mesothelium. Mesothelioma can develop from any of these cell types, but it is most commonly associated with epithelial cells. In fact, around 60-70% of mesothelioma cases are epithelioid mesothelioma, which means the cancer cells have features that resemble epithelial cells.

Epithelial cells are characterized by a tightly-packed arrangement and a distinct shape, which helps them to form a protective barrier. In contrast, the other two types of mesothelial cells, sarcomatoid and biphasic, have a more irregular shape and a looser arrangement.

Epithelioid Mesothelioma: This is the most common subtype of mesothelioma, accounting for about 50-70% of cases. It is characterized by tumor cells that closely resemble normal epithelial cells. These cells tend to form well-defined glandular structures or exhibit a tubular or papillary pattern. Epithelioid mesothelioma cells often retain some of the typical characteristics of epithelial cells, including cell-to-cell adhesion.

all.markers = read.csv(paste0(dir,'data/mks/30293.30298/Takeda.NK.30293.30298.res.0.2.all.markers.23.08.21.csv'), row.names = 1)

**Understanding of the marker gene data **  
p_val (p-value): This represents the statistical significance of the difference in gene expression or expression levels. The p-value indicates whether the observed difference between two groups is likely due to chance. A smaller p-value suggests a significant difference in gene expression.

avg_log2FC (Average Log2 Fold Change): This column shows the average log2 fold change in gene expression or expression levels between two groups. Fold change represents the relative change between the two groups, and log2 transformation is often used for data analysis.

pct.1 (Percentage in Group 1): This column indicates the proportion of this gene's expression or occurrence within Group 1. It tells you how frequently the gene appears in Group 1.

pct.2 (Percentage in Group 2): Similar to pct.1, this column represents the proportion of the gene's expression or occurrence within Group 2.

p_val_adj (Adjusted p-value): This is the adjusted p-value that takes into account multiple hypothesis testing. Performing multiple hypothesis tests can increase the chance of false positives, and adjusted p-values help mitigate this issue.

cluster (Cluster Label): This column provides a label or identifier indicating which cluster or group the gene belongs to. It represents the results of clustering analysis, where genes are grouped based on their function or characteristics.

gene (Gene Name): This is the unique identifier or name of the gene being analyzed.
